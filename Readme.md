# Intention

The intention of this DIY exercise is to practice refactoring using [Gilded Rose](./docs/problem-statement.md). This can be attempted in an individual capacity or as a group. I urge you to practice this as a group using [Mob Programming](./docs//mob-programming.md)

## Assumptions

You should be familiar with the following to be able to attempt this exercise
- Typescript
- Jest testing framework

## Refactoring techniques that can be used

You can use [these](./docs/techniques-that-can-be-used.md) techniques to get started. The code does not have tests to start with. So it might be a good idea to start writing tests first :)
