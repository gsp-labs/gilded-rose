# Mob Programming

Mob programming is a logical extension of pair programming.

In pair programming every idea flows through 2 heads before manifestation. In mob programming every idea flows through several heads before it manifests.

```
All the brilliant minds working on
the same thing
at the same time
in the same space
on the same computer

-- Woody Zuill
```

## Everything together all of the time
- Architecture
- Prioritisation
- Requirements gathering
- Design
- Development
- Testing
- Refactoring
- Release

## What can it solve
- Communication Problems
- Decision Making Problems
- Doing more than is barely sufficient
- Technical Deb
- Thrashing of team members, and the team
- Politics
- Meetings

## Does it work ?

How can we be productive if 5 people are working on the same computer ?

How can we be productive if we separate the people who should be working together ?

Nuff said
